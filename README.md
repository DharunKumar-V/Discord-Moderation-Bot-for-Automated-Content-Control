# Discord-Moderation-Bot-for-Automated-Content-Control
Developed an intelligent Discord moderation bot using Node.js and Discord.js to monitor and enforce server rules. The bot detects abusive language, spam, unauthorized links, and mass mentions in real-time. It applies an automated three-strike enforcement system (Warning → Temporary Mute → Ban) and logs violations in Firebase.
